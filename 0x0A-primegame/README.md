## ðŸ”ŠConcepts Needed:
### ðŸ‘ŒPrime Numbers:

Understanding what prime numbers are.
Efficient algorithms for identifying prime numbers within a range.
### ðŸ§©Sieve of Eratosthenes:

An efficient algorithm for finding all prime numbers up to any given limit, which can be particularly useful for this task.
### ðŸ§ Game Theory:

Basic principles of competitive games where players take turns and the concept of optimal play.
Understanding win conditions and strategies that lead to a win or loss.
### ðŸ¤©Dynamic Programming/Memoization:

Using previous results to make future calculations faster, potentially necessary for optimizing the solution for multiple rounds of the game.
### âœ”Python Programming:

Loops and conditional statements for implementing game logic and algorithms.
Arrays and lists for storing the integers and tracking removed numbers.
