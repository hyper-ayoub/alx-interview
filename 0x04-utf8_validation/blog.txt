# starting for this UTF-8 Validation

# function 
 def validUTF8(data)
 
# setting
 data
 
# return statement
True => 1 if( if data is a valid UTF-8 encoding)
false => 0 else()

! A character in UTF-8 can be 1 to 4 bytes long
! The data set can contain multiple characters
! The data will be represented by a list of integers

=> Each integer represents 1 byte of data
   => you only need to handle the 8 least significant bits of each integer

# Enjoy
