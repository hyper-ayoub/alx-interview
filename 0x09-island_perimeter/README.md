# 😁Concepts Needed:

## ♟2D Arrays (Matrices):

Accessing and iterating over elements in a 2D array.
Understanding how to navigate through adjacent cells (horizontally and vertically).
### 🎨Conditional Logic:

Applying conditions to determine whether a cell contributes to the perimeter of the island.
### 🤩Counting Techniques:

Developing a method to count the edges that contribute to the island’s perimeter.
### 🧵Problem-Solving Strategies:

Breaking down the problem into smaller tasks, such as identifying land cells and calculating their contribution to the perimeter.
## 👌Python Programming:

Nested loops for iterating over grid cells.
Conditional statements to check the status of adjacent cells.
