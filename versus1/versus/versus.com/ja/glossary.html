This method is flawed by low scan resolution and 2D-imaging, which makes it relatively easy to dupe. Currently, the most popular fingerprint scanners are capacitive systems, which utilize electrical current to trace the details of a fingerprint (although a finger mold may still fool it). Another advanced fingerprint recognition tech is ultrasonic scanning. Still quite expensive, ultrasonic fingerprint readers employ high-frequency waves that penetrate the skin and read fingerprint information underneath the epidermis.

The primary purpose is to ensure optimal performance and low latency for each device, regardless of how many are connected at a given time.
